# Hello, Sales & Inventory

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/>

#### Description:

#### Hello, Sales and Inventory software application is an efficient tool that enables businesses to manage their sales and inventory processes effectively. The software has a user-friendly interface with login/register options, and it includes inventory management, sales management, and order processing features.

#### The login/register feature is an essential aspect of the Sales and Inventory software application that allows users to access the system securely. It offers a straightforward and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to register or log in with their credentials. This feature provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.

#### The login page in the Sales and Inventory system offers several key features that enhance user experience and security. One of these features is the remember username and password feature, which enables users to log in quickly without having to enter their login credentials every time. Additionally, the password field is hidden, ensuring that sensitive information is not visible to anyone looking over the user's shoulder. Another important feature of the login page is the error message that appears whenever the username and password do not match, alerting the user of an incorrect login attempt.

#### Same as The Login page ,the Register page is also an essential aspect of any software application that requires users to create an account, and the Sales and Inventory software application is no different. The Register page in the Sales and Inventory system offers several key features that improve user experience  . One of these features is the Confirm Password field, which requires users to enter their password twice to ensure accuracy.

#### Another important feature of the Register page is the error message that appears whenever the password and confirm password fields do not match, alerting the user of a potential mistake. Additionally, if a user attempts to register with a username that already exists in the database, the system will display an error message to prevent duplicate accounts.

#### The Inventory management page is a key component of the Sales and Inventory software application, providing businesses with the tools they need to manage their inventory efficiently. The page comprises a user-friendly table made using Bootstrap that includes essential information, such as Item ID, Item Name, Description, Category, Price, and Stocks.

#### This table provides a powerful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality, allowing users to add new items to the inventory, modify existing entries, retrieve vital information, and remove unwanted records from the system. The Add Item button can be found beside the table headings, While the Edit and Delete button can be found at the right side of the table contents. I made sure to use different colors for each button for ease of distinction. I also made sure to use bootstrap modal for enhanced security.

#### These features offer businesses complete control over their inventory, enabling them to track their stock levels accurately, update product information in real-time, and remove irrelevant items from the database. The page also includes a convenient Search box feature that enables users to quickly locate specific items within the database. This feature is a valuable addition to the Inventory management page, making it easy for businesses to find the items they need without having to browse through large datasets.

#### The Process management page is another essential component of the Sales and Inventory software application, providing businesses with the tools they need to manage their sales processes efficiently. The page includes two tables, with the one at the top containing all the items to be processed.

#### This cart table includes vital information, such as the transaction code, date and time, Item ID, Item Name, Quantity, Price, Overall Total (quantity multiplied by price), and the sum of all items in the cart. Additionally, a Delete button is available to remove an item from the cart, providing businesses with the flexibility they need to modify their orders as required.

#### The second table, located at the bottom of the page, provides businesses with a real-time snapshot of their inventory. This table shares similar features with the Inventory table on the Inventory management page, allowing users to create and read item information. However, the Current Inventory table also includes a quantity input box, which enables users to indicate how many items the customer wants.

#### To further enhance usability, It also includes a Search box that features an auto-search function. I made it so that the Java script automatically searches the inventory database as soon as the user starts typing in the search box, helping to increase efficiency and streamline the search process. Beside it is a Process button ,when clicked a modal pops-out displaying the total amount due, prompts the user to enter the amount paid. Along with a read-only input box that displays the change.

#### To enhance usability and prevent errors, the system includes a check that prevents users from processing transactions with negative change. The Process button will be disabled until the user enters an amount that results in zero or positive change.Once the user has entered the required information, the system processes the transaction and inserts the items into the Sales management page.

#### Finally the last page which is the Sales management page. This page displays transaction information, including the date and time of the sale, item ID, item name, item quantity, and total cost. Additionally, the page includes a total yearly sales figure, providing users with an at-a-glance summary of their sales performance over the year.
